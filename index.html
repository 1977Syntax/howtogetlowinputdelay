        <h2>Why Reducing Input Delay Matters</h2>
        <p>Input delay is the time between pressing a button and seeing the action happen on screen. In fast-paced games like Fortnite, lower input delay can give you a competitive edge by making your gameplay more responsive.</p>

        <h2>Steps to Reduce Input Delay</h2>
        <ol>
            <li><strong>Optimize Game Settings:</strong>
                <p>Lower your in-game graphics settings to reduce the load on your GPU. Focus on key settings like turning off shadows and anti-aliasing to minimize rendering time.</p>
            </li>
            <li><strong>Enable Low Latency Modes:</strong>
                <p>If you have an NVIDIA or AMD graphics card, you can enable specific modes designed to reduce input lag. For NVIDIA, use the Low Latency Mode (Ultra). For AMD, turn on Radeon Anti-Lag.</p>
            </li>
            <li><strong>Use Fullscreen Mode:</strong>
                <p>Playing in fullscreen mode reduces input delay by giving the game full control of the display and avoiding potential conflicts with the desktop environment.</p>
            </li>
            <li><strong>Adjust Polling Rate:</strong>
                <p>Set your mouse polling rate to 1000Hz for faster input recognition.</p>
            </li>
            <li><strong>Update Drivers and Firmware:</strong>
                <p>Ensure your GPU drivers, motherboard firmware, and other essential hardware drivers are up-to-date to avoid performance bottlenecks.</p>
            </li>
            <li><strong>Reduce Background Processes:</strong>
                <p>Close unnecessary programs running in the background to free up system resources, allowing Fortnite to run more efficiently.</p>
            </li>
            <li><strong>Wired Internet Connection:</strong>
                <p>For the best online experience, use a wired Ethernet connection to reduce network latency, which impacts your overall input delay.</p>
            </li>
        </ol>

    <section id="facts">
        <h2>Key Facts About Input Delay</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Input delay</strong> is influenced by hardware (e.g., CPU, GPU, monitor refresh rate) and software (game settings, drivers).</li>
            <li>Lowering graphical settings can increase FPS, reducing input lag as the system processes frames faster.</li>
            <li><strong>Polling rate:</strong> The higher your mouse polling rate, the faster it communicates with your system. 1000Hz is ideal for fast input response.</li>
            <li><strong>Low latency modes</strong> like NVIDIAâ€™s Low Latency Mode reduce the time frames are queued by the GPU, resulting in faster action.</li>
            <li>Playing in <strong>Fullscreen Mode</strong> can eliminate input lag caused by desktop compositors in windowed or borderless modes.</li>
        </ul>
