    <section id="objective">
        <h2>Objective</h2>
        <p>To analyze how network latency affects gameplay in a multiplayer game environment and determine the threshold at which latency begins to impact player performance and experience.</p>
    </section>

    <section id="facts">
        <h2>Key Facts</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Latency refers to the time it takes for data to travel from the playerâ€™s device to the game server and back.</li>
            <li>High latency can lead to lag, causing delays in player actions and affecting overall gaming experience.</li>
            <li>Generally, latency below 50 ms is considered acceptable for fast-paced games.</li>
            <li>Many games implement lag compensation techniques to mitigate the effects of high latency.</li>
            <li>Examples of popular games that handle network latency effectively include Fortnite and Call of Duty.</li>
        </ul>
    </section>

    <section id="methods">
        <h2>Methodology</h2>
        <p>We developed a multiplayer game and introduced varying levels of latency using network simulation tools. Players participated in gameplay sessions, and their performance and feedback were recorded.</p>
    </section>

    <section id="results">
        <h2>Results</h2>
        <p>The analysis of player performance revealed trends that correlate higher latency with decreased performance and increased frustration.</p>
