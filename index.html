            <h2>Tips to Reduce Input Delay</h2>
            <p>Input delay can severely affect your gaming performance in Fortnite. Here are some effective strategies to minimize it:</p>
            <div id="tipsContainer">
                <div class="tip">
                    <h3>Use a LAN Cable</h3>
                    <p>A wired connection can significantly reduce your input delay. Consider using a LAN cable instead of Wi-Fi, as it offers a more stable connection, resulting in lower latency and faster response times.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="tip">
                    <h3>Clear Your PC Regularly</h3>
                    <p>Viruses and unnecessary files can slow down your system, leading to input lag. Use software like Malwarebytes and CCleaner to keep your PC clean and optimized for gaming.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="tip">
                    <h3>Change DNS Settings</h3>
                    <p>Using a fast DNS server can enhance your internet speed. Try setting your DNS to Google's public DNS (8.8.8.8) to see if it improves your connectivity.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="tip">
                    <h3>Optimize Network Settings</h3>
                    <p>Adjust your network card settings to maximize data throughput. Tools like TCP Optimizer can help you fine-tune your settings for optimal performance.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="tip">
                    <h3>Adjust MTU Settings</h3>
                    <p>Set your Maximum Transmission Unit (MTU) to the optimal value for your connection type to improve data transmission efficiency.</p>

            <h2>Fortnite Settings Tips</h2>
            <p>Optimizing your Fortnite settings can greatly reduce input delay. Below are recommended settings:</p>
            <div id="fortniteSettingsContainer">
                <div class="setting">
                    <h3>Set Frame Rate Limit</h3>
                    <p>Cap your FPS at your monitor's refresh rate to avoid unnecessary input delay caused by high frame rates.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="setting">
                    <h3>Disable V-Sync</h3>
                    <p>V-Sync can introduce lag by synchronizing your frame rate with your monitor's refresh rate. Disable it in the settings for improved response times.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="setting">
                    <h3>Lower Graphics Settings</h3>
                    <p>Reducing graphics settings can enhance performance and minimize input delay. Experiment with lower settings to find a balance that works for you.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="setting">
                    <h3>Enable Performance Mode</h3>
                    <p>Switching to Performance Mode in Fortnite settings optimizes the game's performance, reducing input lag and improving frame rates.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="setting">
                    <h3>Adjust Mouse Sensitivity</h3>
                    <p>Finding the right mouse sensitivity can significantly improve your aim and responsiveness in-game. Test different settings to see what feels best for you.</p>
